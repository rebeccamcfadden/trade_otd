# Trade of the Day! Add-on

### Made for Script Jam - Jan 2024

Trade of the Day! is a daily challenge game designed to encourage players to find items from different packs/addons they have in their world.

To start the game, place/interact with the Trader Table block.

Every day, an item is chosen for each player. If the player collects that item and then interacts with the Trader Table while holding the item, they win a prize! Each player can only complete one challenge per day and the challenge must be completed before the end of the day to win. The items are chosen at random with some bias towards non-vanilla packs and packs that player has not yet collected items from.
